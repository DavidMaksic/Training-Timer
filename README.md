## Creating a preset
User has an option to create a preset quickly on the initial screen by pressing the SAVE button. They will see a modal which requires a name to be inputed. This workout will be created based on the initial screen data (sets, work and rest).

After creating a preset as shown above, or after clicking PRESETS button on the main page, user will be navigated to the presets page where all of their custom workouts are displayed. Here they will also have an option to create a new workout.
